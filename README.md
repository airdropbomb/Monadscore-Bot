## **🔹 Overview**  

MSCORE Auto Node Updater is a powerful tool for automating the process of updating wallet start times on the MSCORE network. By integrating proxy support, random delays, and logging mechanisms, it ensures efficient and secure operations without unnecessary duplicate updates.  

The bot reads wallet addresses from `wallets.json`, picks a random proxy (if available), and updates the node start time via API. It also maintains a `log.json` file to track updates and avoid repeating the same action within a single day.  

## **🚀 Features**  

✅ **Automated Updates** – Runs daily at **7 AM**, ensuring wallets stay active.  
✅ **Proxy Support** – Uses proxies from `proxy.txt` to enhance anonymity.  
✅ **Wallet Management** – Reads and processes wallet addresses from `wallets.json`.  
✅ **Logging System** – Prevents redundant updates by tracking execution history.  
✅ **Retry & Delay Mechanism** – Implements randomized delays and retries to handle API failures smoothly.  
✅ **Customizable Execution** – Allows modification of update timings, proxies, and retry settings.
